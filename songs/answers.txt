it's difficut to generalize ther characterization of audio auro by using only from 2018 100 songs
but without considering the feedback of user. But we can make some characterize about their
preffered Energy, tempo, valence, speechiness and danceability based on their 100 songs that
are already listed.
The better way of calculating this aura in my opinion is by using more sophisticated and machine learning models
that can learn from the audio features and the feedback of users to generate dynamic and persoalized mood
descriptors.
