                <p>
                    As a student, my journey through education has been a
                    challenging yet rewarding experience. After completing
                    my high school studies at Chora, I embarked on a new chapter
                    in my life as an undergraduate student at Addis Ababa University.
                    The transition from high school to university was not easy, but with
                    determination and hard work, I have been able to navigate through the academic
                    challenges that come with pursuing higher education. Along the way,
                    I have had the opportunity to explore different fields of study and
                    discover my true passions. As I approach the end of my fifth year as
                    an undergraduate student of Construction of Technology and Management,
                    I am proud of the progress I have made and
                    excited about the possibilities that lie ahead. Despite the obstacles
                    that I have faced, I remain committed to achieving my academic goals and
                     making a positive impact in my chosen field.

                    <p>
                        My academic journey has been greatly influenced by the advancements
                        in technology, which have inspired me to pursue a career in software.
                        I have taken the initiative to enhance my skills through various online
                        resources such as CS50 and FreeCodeCamp, which have provided me with a
                        strong foundation in programming.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        My passion for software has now led me
                        to aspire to become a data scientist in the future.
                        To achieve this goal, I have planned to enroll in the ALX 13-month data science program,
                        which will offer me structured and comprehensive learning opportunities
                        in data science concepts and tools such as machine learning, statistical analysis,
                        and data visualization. With my dedication and hard work,
                        I am confident that my academic journey will lead me towards achieving
                        my dream of becoming a successful data scientist.
